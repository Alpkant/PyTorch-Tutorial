# PyTorch-Tutorial

This repository contains PyTorch Tutorial for **Istanbul Technical University (ITU) BLG506E (Computer Vision) grad course**.    
Codes are based on https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial repository. If you want to see more content please visit that repo.  
I use jupyter notebok and make the tutorials more detailed. Aim of this tutorial is familarizing students with the PyTorch to use it in their term project.    
  
Content of the tutorial as follows:  
1. **PyTorch Basic Ops.** = Basic introduction to tensor operations, ready-to-use datasets, custom datasets, models, saving and loading.  
2. **Basic Training Loop on Toy Dataset** = GPU training, writing a basic training loop and testing loop  
3. **Convolutional Neural Networks and Residual Connections** = Creating validation set and loop, using convolutions, building more complex networks   
4. **Generative Adversarial Network** = GAN training loop  
5. **Tensorboard** = How to monitor training and how to effectively use logger  

I also recommend official PyTorch documentation and tutorials for more information.

If students want to use Keras I recommend the links below. My knowledge about the Keras is limited but I used these resources when I learned Keras. If you know good tutorials you are welcome to contribute.
